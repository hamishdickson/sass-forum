sass-forum
==========

A simple project for demoing sass at a technical forum

To run this, just use 'node server.js' or 'nodemon server.js'

To create a CSS file, run 'gulp' from the terminal


Note that the final sass file which we worked towards in the training session can be found here: https://gist.github.com/hamishdickson/1204f2ec03ec53908e1a
